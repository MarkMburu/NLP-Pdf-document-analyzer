The Train Information Management System (TIMS) shall be a microprocessor\r\n          based control system using the latest and proven technologies of semi-\r\n          conductor, software and data communication to control and monitor the major\r\n          trainborne equipment, such as, the door, brake, propulsion, auxiliary and air\r\n          conditioning systems, through the Train Information Network (TIN). For\r\n          Propulsion and Braking, interface requirements shall be based on IEEE Std\r\n          1475-1999 \u201cIEEE Standard for the Functioning of and Interfaces among\r\n          Propulsion, Friction Brake, and Train-borne Master Control on Rail Rapid\r\n          Transit Vehicles\u201d shall be met.\r\n\r\n\r\n10.1.2.   The design of the TIMS shall consider the train as a total complete system and\r\n          the TIMS shall provide a centralized function to control and monitor all its\r\n          subsystems operation and fault status, fault data logging, incident\r\n          investigation and reporting.\r\n\r\n\r\n10.1.3.   The TIMS shall provide for real-time distributed control and modular\r\n          processing of subsystems in a redundant manner with high reliability and\r\n          availability in the adverse operating environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n10.1.4.   The TIMS shall be designed for ease of fault diagnosis and maintenance.\r\n\r\n\r\n10.1.5.   The TIMS shall function as an Event Recorder to record operating status of\r\n          critical control circuits and components.\r\n\r\n\r\n10.1.6.   The TIMS shall be designed to minimize the needs for individual trainline\r\n          wires and hardwires across couplers. The type of TIMS transmission link to\r\n          be used shall preferably be a screened coaxial cable but a fiber optic cable\r\n          may also be proposed as an alternative. These proposed links shall be proven\r\n          in a comparable operating environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n10.1.7.   The TIMS system and architecture will be developed in order to meet the\r\n\f", "          overall RAMS trainset requirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n10.2      Communication Network Requirements\r\n10.2.1.   Train Information Network (TIN)\r\n\r\n\r\n   (a)    The TIN shall be based on a two-level hierarchy structure consisting of a\r\n          Train Consist Network and System Sub-Network(s). System Sub-Network\r\n          shall be connected to the Train Consist Network via a System Sub-Network\r\n          Gateway. Communications protocols shall be complied with or derived from\r\n          the IEEE Std 1473-1999 \u201cIEEE Standard for Communications Protocol\r\n\f", "                                                            Section 10, page 10-3\r\n\r\n\r\n        Aboard Trains\u201d.\r\n\r\n\r\n(b)     TIN Initialization\r\n\r\n\r\n(i)     The TIN initialization shall be started once the power up initialization of the\r\n        train has occurred. No train operator intervention is required during the\r\n        initialization process.\r\n\r\n\r\n(ii)    The TIN shall first check the healthy status of all the TIN equipment including\r\n        Train Consist Network, System Sub-Networks, ATC / Communications\r\n        Gateways, Gateways, LPU's with real time clock, TIMS display terminal,\r\n        Event Recorder and Control Interface Units.

Each connected device shall\r\n        receive a unique address identifying its position and orientation (left/right,\r\n        front/rear).\r\n\r\n\r\n( i v ) Once the initialization process is completed, data communication service shall\r\n        be started and data shall be able to be transferred among any connected\r\n        devices.\r\n\r\n\r\n( v ) Default operating and control parameters / values (including the recording\r\n       schemes of the Event Recorder) shall be transmitted to each train subsystems.\r\n       These default operating parameters / values shall be able to be viewed, edited\r\n       and changed by maintenance staff when the TIMS is in the Maintenance\r\n       Mode. The default operating and control parameters / values shall set all train\r\n       subsystems / devices in the safe state (for example brakes to be applied and\r\n       doors closed). Operating Parameters shall be modifiable using the Portable PC\r\n       and/or the YMSS computer.\r\n\r\n\r\n( v i ) The train consist shall be uncoupled / coupled on major maintenance activity\r\n        by maintenance staff. The TIN shall be able to maintain partial operation of\r\n        both the Train Consist Network and System sub-network(s) on all uncoupled\r\n        units. This may be achieved by automatic or manual operation of switches,\r\n        insertion of matching resistors or other methods. Once uncoupling / coupling\r\n\f", "       is completed, the TIN shall re-configure itself automatically to enable the data\r\n       communication service unless the cars forming the consist have changed. In\r\n       this eventuality, the consist shall be reconfigured using a portable PC. The\r\n       train consist as recognised by the TIMS shall be displayed on the TIMS\r\n       display terminal.\r\n\r\n\r\n( v i i ) From power up initialization of the train, the TIN of TIMS shall complete its\r\n       initialization and start data transmission within 45 seconds.

The data on the two lines of the Train Consist Network shall be\r\n          continuously monitored and shall be identical. In case of failure of one line,\r\n          data shall still be able to be transmitted and received via the operational line.\r\n          The faulty wire shall be detected and reported to the master LPU.\r\n\r\n\r\n(d)       System Sub-Network\r\n\r\n\r\n( i )     Dedicated shielded twisted pair cables shall be used for the System Sub-\r\n          Network.

The rheostatic braking resistor shall have\r\n         transient thermal capacity to absorb all of the dynamic brake energy, for one\r\n         station stop with W4 passenger loads from maximum speed. This will ensure\r\n         smooth braking transition from the above transient over-voltage conditions.\r\n         However, the thermal capacity of the rheostatic brake resistor shall assume\r\n         continuous 50% line receptivity, followed by a worst case station stop with\r\n         0% line receptivity, without exceeding 650 \u00baC.

In this a correction must be made for\r\n        the effective analysis bandwidth being generally wider than the frequency\r\n        reduction. With the commonly applied Hanning weighting function, the\r\n        analysis bandwidth is 1.5 times the resolution.\r\n                                         2.5\r\n                                         f\r\n         \u2206Ltn,crit = 4.5 - log10 [ 1 + (     )]\r\n(g)     Evaluation                       502\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        The difference between the tone level and the noise level, \u2206Ltn = Lpt - Lpn, is\r\n        compared to a criterion curve. If \u2206Ltn is below the lower curve, the tone is\r\n        masked and cannot be detected by average listeners. If \u2206Ltn is above the\r\n        upper criterion curve, the level of the tone is 6.5 dB above the threshold and is\r\n        described as \"Prominent\" by average listeners.

A minimum of 5\r\n       analyses shall be carried out and the average computed from the average of\r\n       the highest 5 levels. The level of the masking noise is found by averaging over\r\n       at least 2 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n(ii)   It is difficult to approximate time weighting constant F by use of an FFT\r\n       analyzer. The following method is recommended, being validated for ordinary\r\n       400-lines FFT analyzers:\r\n\r\n\r\n( 1 ) With a full scale frequency of 1 kHz, a single spectrum approximates time\r\n      weighting F.\r\n\r\n\r\n( 2 ) With a full scale frequency of 2 kHz or higher, the exponential average of two\r\n      spectra approximates to time weighting F.

General Requirements\r\n\r\n\r\n   (a)     This Section of PS specifies categories of material, tests and requirements of\r\n           fire resistance and reaction to fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n   (b)     The requirements for the reaction to fire performance of the main material\r\n           surfaces vary depending on the location and orientation of the material. The\r\n\f", "                                                                    Section 21, page 21-40\r\n\r\n\r\n           locations are split into interior and exterior. The orientation is described as one\r\n           of three types.\r\n\r\n\r\n           Horizontal Supine (HS)     - orientation as a floor\r\n           Vertical (V)       - orientation as a wall\r\n           Horizontal Prone (HP)      - orientation as a ceiling.\r\n\r\n\r\n           Some testing is item specific and is referenced and described as such.\r\n\r\n\r\n   (c)     The requirements apply to all materials. Where materials are contained in a\r\n           box, e.g. an equipment case, and the box is sealed and2 constructed from a\r\n           material which has fire resistance (by inspection or from certification)\r\n           commensurate with the fire load within the box, then subject to approval, the\r\n           enclosed materials need not comply.\r\n\r\n\r\n   (d)     A category of materials is defined as being minor; i.e. of minor usage. These\r\n           categories are intended to be used for materials, the amount of which in any\r\n           particular area, is insufficient to justify its consideration as a surface. As an\r\n           indication the limiting surface may be taken as 0.01m .\r\n\r\n\r\n   (i)     For interior use, items up to 500g may be considered in this category. For\r\n           exterior use, items up to 2kg may be considered to be in this category.\r\n\r\n\r\n   (ii)    For interior use items below 100g do not require testing. For exterior use\r\n           items below 400g do not require testing.\r\n\r\n\r\n   (e)     The right is reserved to require testing and compliance for items below the\r\n           testing threshold weights if inspection, say, of a materials schedule, indicates\r\n           that the grouping or density of such items may lead to a hazardous situation\r\n           developing.\r\n\r\n\r\n21.10.5.   Fire Resistance Requirements\r\n\r\n\r\n   (a)     Floor\r\n\f", "(i)    The floor shall achieve 30 minutes endurance rating when tested according to\r\n       the ASTM E 119 procedure in NFPA 130.\r\n\r\n\r\n(ii)   The floor sample shall be of a sufficient size to accommodate examples of any\r\n       floor penetrations used on the vehicle.

The\r\n          function of the barrier is to prevent ready movement of air up towards any\r\n          ceiling void promoting a \"chimney\" or \"stack\" effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n( i i )    If warranted by the Fire Hazard Analysis in 25.5.5.c , Any cavity formed in\r\n          the ceiling which is not filled to both faces with a non-combustible (classified\r\n          by a standard called in NFPA 130 or BS 476 : Part 4 ) insulating material shall\r\n          be compartmented across its width at distances not exceeding 5m by the\r\n          inclusion of a barrier. The function of the barrier is to prevent ready\r\n          movement of air through the void which would promote conditions of high\r\n          heat transfer efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(iii)     The barrier shall be prepared from a material which is either by inspection\r\n          (proven on previous contract), or from certification, capable of achieving 30\r\n          minutes integrity to BS 476 : Parts 20 and 22. No fire resistance test of the full\r\n          structure is required.\r\n\r\n\r\n( i v ) The interface between the barrier and the interior faces of the cavity shall be\r\n        protected or bonded in such a way that ready movement of fire products\r\n        between the barrier and either of the faces is prevented when exposed to fire.\r\n        Intumescent protection should be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n( v ) The design and materials shall be submitted for approval.\r\n(d)       Seat Shell (Back & Base)\r\n\f", "   (i)     It is required that the material used to form the seat shell (back and base)\r\n           protects the seat trim from the effects of fire occurring under or around the\r\n           seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n   (ii)    The material shall, therefore, either by inspection (proven on previous\r\n           contract), or from certification be capable of achieving 10 minutes integrity to\r\n           BS 476: Parts 20 and 22. No fire resistance test of the full seat is required.\r\n\r\n\r\n21.10.6.   Reaction to Fire Methods\r\n\f", "                                                              Section 21, page 21-42\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(a)     Surfaces\r\n\r\n\r\n(i)     Flame Retardancy\r\n\r\n\r\n        As an option to the NFPA 130 standards, the methods to be used are BS 476 :\r\n        Parts 6 and 7. Both shall be used in standard form and the requirements are\r\n        given in standard form with the exception that certain surfaces are required to\r\n        be Nil spread for the BS 476 : Part 7 test. This is not a formal categorisation\r\n        under the standard but the information is available in the full report of the tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n(ii)    Smoke Emission\r\n\r\n\r\n        As an option to the NFPA 130 standards, the methods used are BS 6853\r\n        Appendix B5.2, (vertical and horizontal prone) and Appendix B5.4 (horizontal\r\n        supine). The requirements are given in the standard form using the standard\r\n        units.\r\n\r\n\r\n(iii)   Toxic Fume Emission\r\n\r\n\r\n( 1 ) The method to be used is NF X 70 100 (if not applicable, replacement of NF X\r\n      70-100-1 and NF X 70-100-2 is acceptable) or an alternate standard approved\r\n      by the Engineer. The methodology is as standard but there is a requirement to\r\n      measure and consider an additional species, nitrogen dioxide (in the form of\r\n      nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide combined, quoted as nitrogen dioxide).\r\n\r\n\r\n( 2 ) The NF X 70-100 standard normally generates toxic fume emission in units of\r\n      milligrams of species per gram of material combusted. For surfaces this value\r\n      needs to be converted to a notional value on an area basis using information\r\n      specific to the application; e.g. the weight per unit area of the material. (If this\r\n      leads to unrealistically high values for thick materials, this will be considered,\r\n      in the event of a contravention of the requirements occurring, on a case by case\r\n      basis where an effective depth of surface will be defined by the Engineer).\r\n\r\n\r\n( 3 ) For the NF X 70-100 method, the results for all the gases measured, with the\r\n      addition of nitrogen dioxide, should be expressed as grams of toxin per m2 of\r\n      surface. The value generated for each toxin is weighted for relative effect by\r\n      dividing by the reference values also in gm 2.\r\n\f", "( 4 ) The resulting ratios shall be summed to give the weighted summation ratio,\r\n      \"R\".

Use a content domain matrix to select content for questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n3 . Focus the question on a single idea or task derived from a validated resource book\r\n    or job analysis where available.\r\n\r\n\r\n4 . Keep the question job-related and linked to a practical job competency possibly\r\n    through creating a real-life scenario or situation in the stem of the question.\r\n\r\n\r\n5 . Keep items independent. It should not be necessary to know the answer to one item\r\n    to answer another; one item should not provide a clue to another.\r\nLevel of Difficulty\r\n\r\n\r\n6.   Eliminate irrelevant difficulty by:\r\n\r\n\r\n       \u2022 Using simple, familiar language\r\n       \u2022 Using the positive rather than the negative in the stem\r\n       \u2022 Using technical language or jargon only if it is the target of the question\r\n       \u2022 Keeping the reading level of the item at least two grade levels below the\r\n         formal education level of the test taker\r\n       \u2022 Avoiding irrelevant or obscure knowledge or skill areas\r\n\f", "7 .

Use response choices that are close in meaning to make the question more difficult\r\n    and choices that are very different to make it less difficult.\r\nThe Question Stem\r\n\r\n\r\n9 . Keep the stem brief but include sufficient information for the test taker to know\r\n    what is being asked before reading the response choices.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 0 . Try using a short sentence at the beginning of the stem to set up a scenario or\r\n     situation, e.g., You are operating your streetcar on the 510 E line and have\r\n     entered the tunnel to E Station.

Provide four response choices for each question.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 3 . Do not repeat information in each response choice that could be included in the\r\n      stem.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 4 . The response choices should serve either as completions to a statement stem or as\r\n      short replies to a question stem.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 5 . Be sure all response choices are parallel in structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n12. Arrange responses, if possible, in a logical order, e.g., quantitative choices\r\n    in ascending order.\r\nThe Key Answer\r\n\r\n\r\n1 7 . Write the key answer, i.e., the correct answer from the response choices, so that it\r\n      provides a logical and grammatical completion of a statement stem or a logical and\r\n      concise answer to a question.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 8 . Keep the key similar in length, detail, and grammatical construction to the\r\n      distractors.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 9 . Make the response choices, A, B, C and D, the key answer an approximately equal\r\n      number of times in a test.\r\n\r\n\r\n2 0 . Be sure the sequence of key answers is random.\r\nDistractors\r\n\r\n\r\n2 1 . Keep distractors plausible and able to attract respondents who are not fully\r\n\f", "     knowledgeable or skilled.\r\n\r\n\r\n2 2 .

Maintenance Programme\r\n\r\n\r\n   (a)       The Contractor shall establish and provide documentation for a\r\n             comprehensive maintenance programme for upholding the service condition\r\n             (refer to PS 2.1.7) of the trains. The objective of the maintenance programme\r\n             shall be to ensure that the trains will satisfy the following requirements\r\n             throughout their design life:\r\n\r\n\r\n   (i )      Operational safety requirements as defined in PS 25.6\r\n   ( i i )          Reliability requirements as defined in PS 25.7\r\n   ( i i i )    Availability requirements as defined in PS 25.8\r\n   ( i v )     Maintainability requirements as defined in PS 25.9\r\n   ( v )     Quality of comfort, including cleanliness and appearance, experienced by\r\n             passengers\r\n   ( v i )     Minimum life cycle cost\r\n\r\n\r\n   (b)       The maintenance programme shall cover preventive maintenance, corrective\r\n             maintenance, cleaning, condition-based maintenance and any other activities\r\n             necessary to maintain the trains in a condition that can fulfil the above\r\n             requirements. Within the context of this Specification and unless otherwise\r\n             specified, the term 'maintenance' shall include all activities covered by the\r\n             maintenance programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n26.1.2.      Maintenance Policy\r\n\r\n\r\n   (a)       The maintenance programme shall be based on a planned preventive\r\n             maintenance approach. Each train will undergo a series of regular\r\n             maintenance sessions, the contents of which will be increased progressively in\r\n             accordance with the amount of service and in line with the maintenance\r\n             requirements of individual equipment. Where appropriate, condition-based\r\n             maintenance techniques shall also be adopted to minimize the amount of\r\n             maintenance work, downtimes and the associated costs.\r\n\f", "(b)   Service checks and cleaning work shall be so organized that they can be\r\n      completed within the time limits specified under maintainability requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n(c)   All corrective maintenance work shall be completed within the time limits\r\n      specified under maintainability requirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n(d)   The Contractor shall satisfy with himself on the various access restrictions as\r\n      specified in PS 25.8.1(f) that the performance of the Works will not be\r\n\f", "                                                                Section 26, page 26-3\r\n\r\n\r\n          affected.

Paragraphs and Sentences\r\n\r\n\r\n     Limit paragraphs to a single idea. Limit sentences to a single thought; avoid\r\n     compound or complex sentences. Whenever possible, limit words to those that are\r\n     short and familiar to the target audience. Eliminate long, complex sentences and\r\n     paragraphs through the use of lists. The resulting parallel portions of sentences\r\n     shall be individually listed as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n     The beat frequency oscillator has three components:\r\n\r\n\r\n            (1) ...\r\n\f", "                                                              Section 30, page 30-25\r\n\r\n\r\n               (2)...\r\n\r\n\r\n               (3)...\r\n\r\n\r\n10.    Capitalization\r\n\r\n\r\n10.1   All equipment names are to have initial capitals.\r\n\r\n\r\n10.2   Types of equipment, eg. indicator, switch, push button are to begin with:\r\n\r\n\r\n       initial capitals when they are part of an equipment name, eg. Emergency Switch,\r\n       and lower case when they are used generically, eg. check all switches.\r\n\r\n\r\n10.3   When referring to modes or positions, then mode and position does not begin with\r\n       an initial capital, eg. normal position, test mode.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 0 . Quotes\r\n\r\n\r\n       When it is necessary to use quotation marks, double quotation marks are to be\r\n       used.\r\n\r\n\r\n       Example:\r\n\r\n\r\n               \u201cquote\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n12.

The running rail type is of 115 lbs/yard RE section standard carbon steel.\r\n           Head hardened or fully heat treated rail having a Brinell hardness number of\r\n           365 to 380 is installed on both rails of main line curved track having a radius\r\n           less than 600m (1968.5\u2019). At all other locations, running rail is standard\r\n           carbon rail.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.2.       For those curve section of central radius less than 600m (1968.5\u2019), a\r\n           restraining rail is installed. The restraining rail is of 100 lbs/yard A.R.A. \u2013\r\n           Type \u201cA\u201d, horizontally oriented, parallel to the running rails of a track, the\r\n           head of which is contacted by the back of a wheel flange to hold the wheels in\r\n           correct alignment and reduce premature wear of the high rail. Restraining rail\r\n           is typically started on tangent track 3 m (10\u2019) prior to the beginning of a spiral\r\n           or circular and extend 15 m (49\u2019) beyond the end of a spiral or circular curve.\r\n           The restraining rail is located at a gap of 50.8 mm (2\u201d) (minimum) to 63.5 mm\r\n           (2.5\u201d) (maximum) adjacent to the gauge side of the low rail i.e. inside rail.\r\n           Such gap is also known as flangeway. For flangeway compatibility, the back\r\n           to back wheel gauge shall be 1 475 mm \u00b1 1.6 mm (4' 10 1/16\" \u00b1 1/16\").\r\n\r\n\r\n5.3.       For those curve section of central radius less than 600m (1968.5\u2019), a wayside\r\n           track lubricator is installed to reduce rail wear and noise. The lubricator is\r\n           located at the start of a horizontal curve at the point of first full wheel flange \u2013\r\n           rail contact, whereas the exact contact location is site-specific depending on\r\n           curve radius, cant deficiency and train speed. Only the gauge side of the high\r\n           side rail and the contact face of the restraining rail will be lubricated.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.4.

The physical interface point for the Contract shall be defined as the point of\r\n         contact between the collector shoe and the 3 rail system contact rail.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.3.     In accordance with the interface requirements of PS 31, the Contractor shall,\r\n         via the Engineer, liaise with the 3 rail system contractor to provide interface\r\n         specification, design study, delivery schedule, installation, testing and setting\r\n         to work plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. General Description of the 3rd rail system\r\n\r\n2.1.     The supply of traction power to the train will be at a nominal voltage of\r\n         600VDC derived from the 4.16kVAC, 13.8 kVAC or 27.6 kVAC supplies via\r\n         the Rectifier Transformer and Rectifiers (T-R)rd units at traction substations.\r\n         The traction power supply system utilizes 6-pulse or rd12-pulse rectifications\r\n         with corresponding ripplerd frequencies of 720 Hz. The rectifier output is\r\n         typically operated at not more than 2 % ripple content. Harmonics of these\r\n         frequencies would also be present. System voltages are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n         Nominal direct voltage of the high voltage system        600 VDC\r\n         Average voltage at collector shoe                580 VDC\r\n              rd\r\n         Minimum voltage at collector shoe                        350 VDC\r\n         Maximum voltage at collector shoe                        720 VDC\r\n\f", "2.2.   Currents will be supplied to the train by the 3 rail system and will return to\r\n       the traction substations via the running rails. The 3 rail system will be\r\n       connected such that the 3 rail is at positive potential and is mounted on\r\n       insulators to the outside of and slightly higher than the running rails. The\r\n       return of the circuit is via the running rails. The current is collected by the\r\n       train through the collector shoes, attached to the trucks, which slide along the\r\n       top of the contact rail. Polarity is negative grounded to the running rail and the\r\n       negative running rail is floating with respect to ground in some areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.3.   The 3 rail system will consist of a number of traction substations such that it\r\n\f", "                                            Appendix I Annex 2, page AppI Ann2-3\r\n\r\n                                                         rd\r\n          forms a continuous system which will supply power to the trains without\r\n          interruption under normal conditions. The 3 rail system will, however, be\r\n          divided into a number of electrical sections between the traction substations to\r\n          meet the operational requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.4.      The typical traction gap (refer to Clause 4.3(a) below) distance is 21.03 m (69\r\n          feet) and the existing contact rail arrangement shall refer to Contract Drawing\r\n          No. NST 070.\r\n                                            2\r\n\r\n2.5.      The third rail, a.k.a. contact rail, supplies the 600 VDC traction power to the\r\n          vehicle via a sliding current collector shoe. The collector shoe rides on the top\r\n          surface of the contact rail. The contact rail is of 74 kg/m rail section, having a\r\n                                                                      rd\r\n          cross-sectional area of 9420 mm .

Supply Voltage\r\n\r\n\r\n          The nominal 3 rail system voltage is 600 VDC. All train performance\r\n          requirements in motoring, except as otherwise stated, shall be met or\r\n          surpassed at all voltages from 580 VDC and 720 VDC. Between 350 VDC\r\n          and 580 VDC, the train may operate at reduced performance, by reducing the\r\n          base speed. This shall maintain the traction line current below the maximum\r\n          level specified in section 3.4 below.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.2.

In view of the fact that severe\r\n          service interruption will be caused by the operation of the DC track feeder\r\n          circuit breaker due to an overcurrent fault, the design of the train system shall\r\n          be capable to clear the overcurrent fault of the train equipment, such as, the\r\n          traction system (refer to PS 11), without causing superfluous operation the 3rd\r\n          rail system DC track feeder circuit breaker.\r\n                          rd\r\n                               rd\r\n3.4.

In order to avoid nuisance\r\n          tripping of the 3 rail system DC track feeder breaker, the design of the\r\n          traction system (refer to PS 11) of the train shall not exceed the current limits\r\n          of the T1 train.                                                         rd\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    (b)   The inrush current shall be limited to be no greater than 150 A/ms per car, or\r\n          900 A/msec per 6 Car train, under all operating conditions.\r\n                                                                                          rd\r\n\r\n3.5.

General\r\n\r\n1.1.     Introduction\r\n\r\n\r\n1.1.1.   This Annex defines the interface requirements for the Automatic Train\r\n         Control (ATC) system which includes both the existing signalling system and\r\n         the Speed Control System (SCS), and the train systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.1.2.   The Named Suppliers of the existing signalling system (e.g. the trip switch)\r\n         and the Speed Control System (SCS) who will be called hereafter the ATC\r\n         Named Supplier, shall be in accordance with Appendix D. The Contractor\r\n         shall purchase from the Named Supplier all ATC equipment as stipulated in\r\n         this Annex. Deliverables shall be limited to existing T1 SCS documentation as\r\n         revised to meet design changes if applicable.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.1.3.   The baseline interface design of the ATC and train system shall be based on\r\n         the T1 train. Wherever there is any requirements as specified in this Annex\r\n         duplicate requirements for a particular criterion of the baseline interface\r\n         design, the more stringent requirement shall apply. Any conflict in\r\n         requirements shall be brought to the attention of the Engineer.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.1.4.   Unless otherwise specified, the Contractor shall ensure hardware inter-\r\n         changeability of all SCS equipment between the T1 train and the train.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.1.5.   The SCS shall provide continuous on-board enforcement of train operating\r\n         speed limits and shall realize important safety benefits in the subway. The\r\n         system shall eventually replace the existing signalling system which adopts\r\n         the current Grade Timing method of speed enforcement and uses timer relays\r\n         as well as lunar white and flashing red aspects to enforce speed limits.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.1.6.   In order to ensure the compatibility between the existing signalling system /\r\n         SCS and the train systems, the following system requirements and design\r\n         constraints for the ATC interface are specified according to the experience\r\n\f", "         gained from the operation of the Existing Subway Lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.1.7.

Station Operation\r\n\r\n\r\n               In order to ensure passenger\u2019s comfort, the existing function of passenger\r\n               information management are provided by the ATC via the Radio. This\r\n               function is to provide information for the Radio (refer to PS 18.2) via an audio\r\n               link to inform the train passengers of the name of the next station and the\r\n               destination of the train. For the NST, this function of providing passenger\r\n               information management by the ATC shall be implemented by the interface\r\n               between the ATC and the communication equipment (refer to PS 18.2) via the\r\n               serial link connection which shall be identical with the above interface\r\n               between the ATC and radio (refer to Appendix I Annex 4).\r\n\f", "2.1.2.   Automatic Train Protection (ATP)\r\n\r\n\r\n         The ATP system is to determine the maximum safe speed for the train and\r\n         compare it with the actual speed. If the maximum safe speed is exceeded, the\r\n         ATP system shall cause the emergency brake to be applied. For SCS mode\r\n         (refer to PS 9.5) of operation, the maximum safe speed is 80 km/h (50 MPH).\r\n\r\n\r\n2.1.3.   Driving information management\r\n\f", "                                           Appendix I Annex 3, page AppI Ann3-9\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          To provide driving information to the train operator through the train operator\r\n          display (TOD).\r\n\r\n\r\n2.1.4.    Failure management\r\n\r\n\r\n          Fault record of VOBC shall be transmitted to the TIMS via a dedicated RS232\r\n          serial link, the TIMS shall send the critical fault event to the TCC via the radio\r\n          link (refer to PS 10.3.5(e)). In the event of unrecoverable SCS failure and it is\r\n          required to completely disconnect the VOBC from the train control, a sealed\r\n          type SCS By-pass Switch shall be provided to cut-out the power of the VOBC\r\n          and override all SCS related interlocking functions. Other requirements of the\r\n          SCS By-pass Switch shall refer to PS 9.5.2.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.2.      Detailed Functions\r\n\r\n\r\n2.2.1.    Station Operation\r\n\r\n\r\n          With the existing T1 interface design, when the VOBC receives the wayside\r\n          transponder Tag ID number, this information, in a form of coded message,\r\n          will be sent to and decoded by, the Radio via a dedicated RS232 serial link.\r\n          Based on the above tag information, the Radio will be able to inform the train\r\n          passengers by the built-in Station Stop Announcement System through the PA\r\n          system accordingly. With the NST interface, when the VOBC receives the\r\n          wayside transponder Tag ID number, this information shall be sent from the\r\n          VOBC to the communication equipment via a serial link connection which\r\n          shall be identical with the above interface between the VOBC and radio (refer\r\n          to Appendix I Annex 4).

AUTHORITY\u2019s maintenance philosophy requires strict\r\n      adherence to serialised parts tracking and computerised record keeping so that\r\n      a complete component history is always up to date and available. Serial\r\n      exchanges of components along with original installations for the first time or\r\n      subsequent times along with other attributes requires documenting on\r\n      AUTHORITY Work Orders for central processing into a computerised Work\r\n      Order System.

Serial Number Allocation\r\n\r\n\r\n3.1       Since the serial number and component description act together as a unique\r\n          identifier, it is preferable to keep the serial number a relatively short number.\r\n          The serial may contain leading or trailing letters.

AUTHORITY will submit at NTP a list of existing\r\n          AUTHORITY serialized component that includes Manufacture part number,\r\n\f", "        AUTHORITY stock Code and AUTHORITY short description.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.3     Components that shall be serialized shall fall in one of the following\r\n        categories:\r\n3.3.1   Assemblies for which a First Article Inspection is required, except for exterior\r\n        and interior lighting, floor heaters, and passenger seats.\r\n3.3.2   All circuit card assemblies, where space permit.\r\n3.3.3   Suppliers serialized components.\r\n\f", "                                                         Appendix J, page AppJ-4\r\n\r\n\r\n3.4       Any serialized components that are commercially available shall not be bar-\r\n          coded in compliance with this Appendix requirement. Supplier bar code shall\r\n          be used and it shall be to the discretion of AUTHORITY to include these\r\n          items in the car builder serialization package.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.5       The number of serialized component, per car, shall not exceed 400 unique line\r\n          of data entry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.        Serialised Component Description\r\n\r\n\r\n4.1       Each component group or type requires a unique descriptive identifier (up to\r\n          15 characters) in addition to a serial number. The format of each description\r\n          generally follows a common theme where short forms or simple acronyms are\r\n          put together to create this description. An example of a NST traction motor\r\n          could be \u201cMotorTMNST\u201d where \u201cMotor\u201d is a common description, \u201cTM\u201d is\r\n          the subsystem identifier and \u201cNST\u201d is of course the vehicle type. The \u201cBlue\r\n          book\u201d is a good example to follow. AUTHORITY will submit to the\r\n          Contractor T1 Blue book at NPT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.        Serialised Component Hierarchy\r\n\r\n\r\n5.1    The structure of serialised components can sometimes be multi-leveled.\r\nAUTHORITY\r\n          makes use of the structure by each component having a next higher assembly\r\n          (NHA). In some cases this NHA is the vehicle itself, in others is can be an\r\n          assembly where it could have sub-assemblies. It is cases like this where an\r\n          assembly that has sub-assemblies can be exchanged that AUTHORITY has\r\n          created this NHA relationship. This structure is sometimes referred to as\r\n          parent and child relationship. AUTHORITY\u2019s Work Order system makes\r\n          efficient use of this NHA identifier and automatically maintains the\r\n          configuration of any sub-assemblies during its exchange. Each component\r\n          must have at least one NHA identifier. As an example the \u201cMotorTMNST\u201d\r\n          could have either \u201cTruck1NST\u201d or \u201cTruck2NST\u201d. This way when a truck is\r\n          exchanged the axle sets, gearboxes, brake cylinders and any other truck\r\n          mounted equipment are still attached to the truck and configuration is\r\n          maintained.\r\n\f", "6.      Stock Code\r\n\r\n\r\n6.1     The Stock code is a AUTHORITY supplied stock code based on vendor supply\r\ndata,\r\n        cross referenced through Material Systems information. Each component\r\n        (serialised or not) should have a AUTHORITY assigned stock code. From the\r\n        drawing approval cycle of SEMP 2 and SEMP 3, AUTHORITY will assign\r\n        Stock Code Number and Description to allow the Car-builder to assign a\r\n        specific one to each component. Where a serialised component is concerned\r\n        this stock code shall\r\n\f", "                                                           Appendix J, page AppJ-5\r\n\r\n\r\n          be part of the identification Label.

Bar Code\r\n\r\n\r\n7.1       A bar code shall be part of the serial plate and or label where possible. This\r\n          bar code shall be made up of the serial, description and stock code so that a\r\n          reference table can be utilised with scanning methods to automatically return\r\n          all appropriate component information. This electronic file format will be\r\n          provided by AUTHORITY at SEMP 1, and is to be delivered by the\r\n          Contractor prior to the delivery of the first Subway Car. The Bar code\r\n          requirement is primarily for AUTHORITY\u2019s in-house Materials system. Shall\r\n          the Contractor or its Supplier already has a bar coding process in place, it is\r\n          acceptable to have two bar code installed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8.

Using\r\n\f", "the\r\n      Blue Book example along with AUTHORITY\u2019s assistance using a generic\r\n      rule set (to be provided by AUTHORITY) the Contractor shall enforce this\r\n      requirement on all sub vendor serialised parts.

Background\r\n\r\n\r\n3.1        The backup battery sets on the subway, streetcar and SRT vehicle fleets\r\n           require preventative maintenance and testing on a regular basis. This testing\r\n           requirement is based on a current fleet size of 600 battery sets. That is 350 sets\r\n           from subway/SRT vehicles and 250 sets from streetcars plus the battery sets\r\n           (refer to PS 17.4.2) from the train (also known as the New Subway Train in\r\n           this Appendix).\r\n\f", "3.2   It is a requirement that, based on a 5 year cycle, one 8 hour shift per day and a\r\n      5 day work week, the existing productivity of processing of a battery set on\r\n      every 2 days shall be maintained by using the Charger.\r\n\f", "                                                      Appendix K, page AppK-3\r\n\r\n\r\n14.   Definitions\r\n\r\n\r\n4.1   Battery Cell Block \u2013 In certain battery sets the cells come in 2 cell or 3 cell\r\n      packages called Blocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.2   Battery Set \u2013 A specific number of cell blocks connected together to get the\r\n      proper terminal voltage for the vehicle type. For example, an H6 battery set\r\n      has two 3 cell blocks and ten 2 cell blocks for a total of 26 cells.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.3   Test Stub \u2013 The software subroutine that controls a specific function of the\r\n      whole battery set test. For example the subroutine that governs the discharge\r\n      process.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.4   Charge Rates - The current that a Charger supplies to the battery is normally\r\n      expressed as a fraction of the theoretical current (for a given battery) needed\r\n      to charge the battery completely in 1 hour. This theoretical current is called\r\n      the nominal battery capacity rating and is represented as \u201cC.\u201d For example, a\r\n      current of 0.1 C is that current which, in 10 hours, theoretically, would\r\n      recharge the battery fully. The required charging rates for various styles of\r\n      recharging shall refer to the battery manufacturer\u2019s manual.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.5   Thermal Runaway - If the constant current is applied past the point when the\r\n      battery reaches approximately 85% of its fully charged state, the excess heat\r\n      will cause \u201cthermal runaway\u201d to occur. Under thermal runaway conditions,\r\n      the excess heat in the battery will cause its voltage to drop. The drop in\r\n      voltage will cause the charge rate to increase, generating more heat and\r\n      accelerating the cycle. The temperature and internal pressure of the battery\r\n      will continue to rise until permanent damage results.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.6   Operator - The qualified battery maintenance personnel of the AUTHORITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15.   Scope of Work\r\n\f", "5.1     The scope of work shall comprise, unless specifically excluded, the design,\r\n        manufacture, supply, delivery, installation, testing, commissioning and\r\n        rectification of defects during the 2 Years Warranty Period for the Charger\r\n        and the associated equipment necessary to facilitate operation and\r\n        maintenance of the battery sets which include special tools and testing\r\n        equipment, spare parts and Operation and Maintenance Manuals and training,\r\n        as specified in this Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.2     The Charger shall be able to perform the following duties:\r\n5.2.1   Normal duty: charging and testing two (2) battery sets simultaneously;\r\n5.2.2   Peak duty: simultaneously testing and conditioning an additional two (2)\r\n        battery sets; and\r\n\f", "                                                        Appendix K, page AppK-4\r\n\r\n\r\n5.2.3   Conditional duty: charging, testing and capacity recovering an individual\r\n        battery cell or one Battery Cell Block; or\r\n5.2.4   Future duty: being expandable to simultaneously testing and conditioning up\r\n        to eight (8) battery sets in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.3     The Charger shall be a service proven, automatic, computer-controlled,\r\n        switching power electronic featured and self-contained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16.
